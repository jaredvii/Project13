# Project 13 Jared Allan

This will include the 3 challenges required for Project 13:

Step One
Complete the following:
Sign up for free accounts on LeetCode, Hackerrank, and CodeWars
Create a GitHub repository with 3 folders (one for each of the above platforms), and a brief README file with at least 2 sentences describing your repo
Work on 2 - 3 beginner level challenges from any of the above platforms (or one from each!)
Push all of your code to the GitHub repo you created
Submit a link to your repo and, if it’s a private repo, add your TA as a collaborator

Challenge 1: Input date/Fetch day - User inputs # of dates and dates in prompt for day to be outputed in console.
Challenge 2: Write a function that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a sorted array containing the same strings, ordered from shortest to longest.
Challenge 3: Write a function, nicknameGenerator that takes a string name as an argument and returns the first 3 or 4 letters as a nickname.

Step Two
Add the calculator mini project (from Lesson 1.3), or another project you completed outside of class, to the projects section of your website. The styling is up to you, but you should include a screenshot, a title, a brief description, and a link to the code on GitHub. Finally, submit the GitHub link below (again, if it’s a private repo, be sure to add your TA as a collaborator).

These challenges will be for part one of this assignment.
